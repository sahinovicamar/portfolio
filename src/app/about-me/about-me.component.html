                    <span>I am a German-speaking Software Developer with experience in building web
                        apps with JavaScript & Angular. Since I have always been interested in
                        programming, this was my next logical step to enter and develop in this
                        profession. <br>
                        <br>
                        I started my IT journey coding small websites at home and then
                        decided to get professional training and build projects. I am looking forward
                        to building on my experience and starting my career in IT in a junior developer
                        position.
